### Community Rules

Our Discord server is a very active community of people from all over the world and is moderated by a team of volunteers. Our moderation team has 3 different [roles](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/top-meta/blob/main/about/discord-roles.md): Core, Maintainer, and Moderator.

Our moderation team is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodivergence, personal appearance, body, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

We expect everyone to handle themselves in a professional manner and follow the spirit of our community rules. The moderation team enforces our rules through a zap system using the Dyno bot. The zaps are private to the user and will be communicated through direct messages or private threads.

If you are given a warning by our moderation team, please consider our point of view and be willing to change without taking it personally or being argumentative. Our rules are very similar to the expectations in professional workplaces, so this will better prepare you to interact professionally with your future teammates.

Our rules have different levels of severity and zaps are given at the discretion of the moderator team. Repeated offenses automatically increase to the next penalty tier. Zaps accumulate over time if rules continue to be broken to ensure the well-being of our entire community.

10 total zaps result in a ban.

#### 0 Zaps (Heads Up)

* Dog piling/short circuiting a teaching moment (E.g jumping in to help when someone else is already helping out, giving an answer when someone is leading someone to think critically about their problem)
* Asking about or encouraging the use of Windows
* "Chat bombing", aka posting many short (ususally 4-5 or fewer words) messages in rapid succession, repeatedly sending parts of thoughts (incomplete, non-standalone sentences or fragments) in new messages. (Use shift + enter and send ONE message where possible or edit your message)
* Discussing mental health issues in depth or seeking mental health help from other users
* Inappropriate User Profile - Profile Picture, Username/Nickname, Bio (E.g. suggestive or inappropriate memes)
* Crossposting or Duplicate Posts
    * Examples:  posting the same message to different channels or asking for help in multiple channels at once.
    * You should allow at least **30 minutes** for a reply. While you are waiting, make sure that you posted in the most relevant channel, provided a [detailed question](https://www.theodinproject.com/how_to_ask), and continue trouble-shooting. It is recommended to edit your post with the results of things you have tried. If your post gets buried, you may repost your question, otherwise, you may direct people to your question in a more active channel.

#### 1 Zap (WARNING)

Minor violations such as:

* A second infraction of any 0 Zap issues above
* "Mini-modding" or non-moderators expressing authority
  * Our moderation team has been trained to handle rule breaking in a private and respectful manner. Although we know you mean well, do not instruct another user in an authoritative manner. This leads to public disagreements which creates an unwelcoming environment.
  * Example: You telling another user that they broke a rule.
  * Alternative: Use ModMail to report rule breaking or if you see something you’re unsure about in the community
* Asking for advice/help on homework or personal projects, even if the topic is covered by our curriculum
* Mild unprofessionalism:
  * Drug related conversation
  * Treating others on the server disrespectfully
  * Relationship advice

#### 2 Zaps (WARNING)

Medium severity violations such as:

* Suggesting piracy
* Unsolicited pings/DM/friend request
* Political or religious topics
* Mild toxicity:
  * Directed insults
  * Provoking/baiting other users
  * Passive aggression
  * Naming & shaming
* Self promo without permission (ask with Modmail)
  * Do not share resources you have created solely for personal or monetary gain
  * Examples: "Fill out my survey" (does not help the goals of Odin), "Join my boot camp/program/server" (Could mislead learners), "Why PHP is superior" (unrelated blog post), job recruitment

#### 5 Zaps (SEVERE WARNING)

High severity violations such as:

* Posting about any illegal activities
* Publicly arguing about receiving moderation activity after being asked to take it to ModMail/discuss privately
* Excessive toxicity (targeted harassment, inciting drama, aggressively arguing purposefully, etc.)
* Plagiarism (for example: Stealing other learners' work)

#### 10 Zaps (Immediate Ban)

Extreme severity violations such as:

* Bigotry (racism, homophobia, hate speech etc)
* Continued harassment
* NSFW or otherwise highly offensive imagery in posts, profile pictures, or usernames
* Spamming
  * Discord Nitro spam
  * Self promotion (joining just to promote material, no prior chat history)
  * Repeated random nonsensical messages (copypasta)
* Doxxing
* Piracy
* Any other behavior deemed unacceptable and deserving of a ban by the moderation team, such as not correcting “[help vampire](https://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/)” behaviors.

#### Example of Decaying Zaps

Zaps decay at a rate of 1 zap per week. E.g., if you receive 5 zaps on a Friday, the following Friday you will have 4, the Friday after that you will have 3, and so forth. This means higher level infractions remain on record for a longer period of time, and more strongly jeopardize your ability to participate in the server if rules are continued to be broken.

#### Example of Increasing Zaps for Repeated Offenses

1. Kierra is warned about dogpiling once, which earns her zero zaps as it is a first warning for a minor violation.
2. Two days later, Kierra is warned about dogpiling again, and earns a single zap as she has already been warned. She now has 1 zap.
3. The next day, Kierra is once again warned about dogpiling. This now earns her two zaps for a total of 3 zaps.
4. The day after that, Kierra is warned about dogpiling and earns 5 zaps, for a total of 8 zaps.
5. The next time Kierra is warned about dogpiling, she earns 10 zaps and is now banned from the server as she has accumulated 18 zaps.

#### Example of Mini-Modding

1. Darius posts a question about needing help on a freelance project.
2. Jacob replies to Darius saying, "We do not support personal projects, see the rules"
3. Darius is now upset because of the terseness of Jacob's reply and the two are now arguing.
4. Jacob should have instead reported this to @ModMail so a member of the moderation team could privately address this issue with Darius.

Instructing another user in an authoritative manner leads to public disagreements which creates an unwelcoming environment. Instead, Jacob should have reported this to @ModMail so a member of the moderation team could notify Darius of the rules in private.

#### Conclusion

This is not a comprehensive list of all possible scenarios and zaps are made at the discretion of the moderation team if particular behaviors are inappropriate but not otherwise explicitly covered. Please DM @ModMail if you would like to discuss this matrix or any moderation activity (whether you are on the receiving end or not).

#### Regarding the Moderation Team
The moderation team, as well as the Core and Maintainer team, are also subject to the rules. If you see any issues amongst the team, please report it to @ModMail with a link to the issue and brief description of what you feel may have been violated. *Please do not argue publicly, take it to the correct channels of communication to deal with this.* Please note that the entire TOP team has visibility on ModMail. If it makes you more comfortable, you may DM one member of the team with your concerns, or email the team at theodinproject@gmail.com.
